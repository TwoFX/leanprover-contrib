# leanprover-contrib

This repo creates some basic checkin/CI for Lean projects that are not part of mathlib.

It is still in a design phase. What I envision is this:

* The maintainer of an external project adds their package info to [projects.yml](blob/master/projects/projects.yml).
  This project should have some number of `lean-3.*.*` branches.
  Any dependencies of the project must also be listed in `projects.yml`.

* Daily, we pull the current versions of all checked in projects, as well as mathlib.
  We try to build each `lean-3.*.*` branch of each project,
  with the project's dependencies updated.
  We do this with a topological sort. For example, suppose we're working with `lean-3.16.3`.
  1. Set `mathlib` to its `3.16.3` branch.
  2. For project `P1` that depends only on `mathlib`, build its `3.16.3` branch against `mathlib` from step 1.
  3. For project `P2` that depends on `mathlib` and `P1`, build its `3.16.3` branch against `mathlib` from step 1 and `P1` from step 2.

* If a project fails, we notify the project owners.
  This failure may be caused by changes in a dependency (probably mathlib) or a downstream failure.

* We also want to notice when new Lean versions are released,
  check if projects can be updated without changes,
  and suggest to project owners that they create a new `lean-3.*.*` branch.


## TODO

* The logic to test new Lean versions isn't there yet.
* Put things into CI, including failure/upgrade notifications (as issues or PRs to the project repo?)
* Right now projects are assumed to be forked to the `leanprover-contrib` org, change this.
* We should track the head SHA of each branch. 
  If no SHAs change for a particlar Lean version, there's no need to rerun tests on that version.
  This is very likely for old versions of Lean.
  Unfortunately this means we have to store state between runs.
* Use `mathlibtools` as a Python project instead of `leanproject` CLI?
* We can list checked in projects on the community website. (Sorted by # of GH stars as popularity maybe?)
* It's essential that projects keep the latest `lean-3.*.*` branch updated
  instead of working only on `master`. 
  We should provide a GH Action that mirrors `master` to the right branch.
